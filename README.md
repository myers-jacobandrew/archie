Experimenting with ASR, CMUSphinx - https://cmusphinx.github.io/ , VOSK and other tools. 

Not sure what the end goal for this project yet, easy to envision a massive JARVIS-adjacent virtual assistant. But for now this will start as a few lines of code and I'll expand things as new ideas/needs come up.
